"To account for the different input depths, each CC [...] transform is 
programmatically defined to linearly interpolate between the input and the
output depth.

Note: In SwinT-ChARM a slightly different logic is used, which is why the depth 
is explicitly hardcoded here.

For example, the tenth slice should have depths: 224, 128 and 32.
