## Technical Differences

IMPORTANT: only affects branch release_08/17/2022 (the differences have been resolved!)

In comparison to Zhu et al.:

- we keep LPR (lrp_transforms) -> no motivation given for removal.
- for CC, LPR we keep the approach described in Minnen et al., Appendix A.; i.e. 
the input to slice_1 is 320, input to slice_2 is 352 etc. rather than 32, 64, 
... as described in Zhu et al. Appendix A, Figure 12.

Further technical deviations are possible, as we base our work on the official 
TF implementation of Minnen et al., while Zhu et al. base their work on an
unknown (possibly not publicly available) PyTorch reimplementation.
